Here is a list of information that's not directly in the 'system' but need to be constant.

Inside the main game view (the shoot 'em up areas) the max play space for the enemies/player is
X AXIS: -4 through 4. 8 units total.
Y AXIS: -5 through 5. 10 units total

Although keep in mind the player area is 2 units at the bottom. So only place enemies 5 through -3 on the Y AXIS
to prevent unintentional player collision with the enemy and vice/versa. 

The rest of the screen is reserved for the HUD.
